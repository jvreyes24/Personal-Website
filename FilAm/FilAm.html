    <!--Intro Statement-->
    <div class="intro">
        <p>
            Fil-Am Cuisine is a community favorite for Filipino food and their famous 
            barbeque skewers. Locals and tourists alike, line up to taste their 
            secret family recipes. After more than forty years in business, 
            Fil-Am cuisine still brings in hundreds of customers everyday. 
            Although they have an active website, 
            I wanted to redesign it in my own style.

    <!--Fil-Am: Current Website Breakdwon/Analysis-->
    <h3>Fil-Am Cuisine: Current Website</h3>

    <div class="central">
        <p>
            Fil-Am Cuisne's current homepage features a straightforward and 
            user-friendly design that reflects the restaurant's focus on authentic 
            Filipino comfort food. The homepage provides the necessary information 
            a visitor may need such as their hours and locations, 
            their mission statement, and a rotating gallery of images showcasing 
            popular dishes such as BBQ skewers, pancit, and beefsteak tagalog to 
            provide visitors with an appetizing preview of the menu offerings. 
            The homepage flows well with their use of images, their distribution 
            of elements, and the three boxes with their hours, location, and contact 
            information. Visually, the site incorporates a variety of different elements 
            including a wood background and a navigation bar similar to a strip of film, 
            but they have a disconnect in their relevance. The wooden background gives 
            homage to traditional Filipino homes called “Bahay Kubo” but the film 
            strip navigation bar does not relate to the wooden background or their 
            restaurant. In addition, their layout seems disorganized. Their logo takes up 
            a sizable amount of space on top of the navigation bar and the main information 
            and links are in the center making it seem that the background was placed 
            to fill up the empty space.
        </p>
    
        <p class="note">
            Note: Fil-Am Cuisine's website was shut down and I had to use the WayBack Machine to get a screenshot
        </p>

        <p>
            Their “About” page gives a summary of their restaurant, their food, and their 
            catering services, but does not dive into their roots and beginnings for visitors 
            wanting to know about their history. Although it does not overwhelm the visitor 
            with a lot of text, it achieves the opposite by not giving a lot of information and 
            lacks the personable touch that is common with small family-owned local businesses. 
            The “About” page also lacks much interaction with visitors by exclusively having text.
        </p>
    </div>
    
    <div class="central">
        <p>
            Their “Menu” page has a good layout with a pdf of their menu in the corner and four 
            pictures and hyperlinks showcasing the four different types of food they specialize 
            in: Fil-Am Specials, A La Carte, Entrees, and Desserts. Although it is designed well, 
            the “Menu” page separates their menu too much by having it be broken down into four 
            different hyperlinks. In addition, the Entree hyperlink brings visitors to the 
            homepage and expects them to go through each image for their menu. The Fil-Am Specials 
            hyperlink sends the visitor to a page that is unavailable. The dessert menu does not 
            have a hyperlink for visitors to see their desserts. The only working and well designed 
            menu page is the A La Carte section.
        </p>
    
    </div>

    <div class="central">
        
        <p>
            The “Catering” Page provides images of their most popular dishes, but gives redundant 
            information. Under the images in small text, the page gives the restaurant's phone 
            number and tells the visitor to call for their catering needs. Below that is extremely 
            bolded text that is difficult to read and gives the same information.
        </p>  
    </div>
   

    <p class="central">
        Overall, Fil-Am Cuisine's website functions well and gives all the information visitors 
        need, but has issues with navigation, flow, and disconnecting elements.
    </p>

    <!--Breakdown of Design inspirations-->
    <h3>Design Inspiration</h3>

    <p class="central">
        For inspiration in this redesigning, I looked into popular restaurants and other 
        Filipino restaurants' websites to see how their website flows and reflects their 
        food, culture, and theme through their design. The four main restaurants I looked 
        into were Abaca, Kasama, Miss Lily's, and China Poblano.
    </p>

        <img src="assets/ChinaPoblano.jpg">
    </div>

    <p class="central">
        Most of these websites utilized bold and eye-catching colors to add character to 
        their website while having a layout that utilized images of their food as much as 
        possible. Since all of these restaurants are more focused on a dine-in experience, 
        there were some elements and tools that were not necessary for Fil-Am Cuisine's redesign.
    </p>

    <!--Breakdown of Design Process-->
    <h3>Design Process</h3>

    <p class="central">
        My design process started out by writing down key ideas and design choices I thought were 
        important to include based off the current website and the website inspirations I researched. 
        I wrote down what information I wanted each page to have and the key functions they should 
        accomplish. For example, I wanted the Homepage to give a good sense of what the restaurant 
        is, feature pictures of their most popular dishes, and have important information like 
        their hours and location. From there, I created hand drawn sketches to organize my ideas 
        and easily create mockups to see how they would look.
    </p>

    <p class="central">
        After that, I went on Figma to create Lo-Fi prototypes of each page and the different design 
        layouts ideas. I personally like to create multiple versions of pages because it helps me 
        see how different ideas would look and choose elements that I think would work well into the 
        final product. Multiple design choices helps me mix and match different pages, tweak the overall 
        designs to flow better, and add in elements from different versions. I then create the Hi-Fi 
        prototype to give me an even better overview of all my designs and make any necessary changes. 
        Finally, I created a final prototype that would be my definitive version.

    <h3>Fil-Am Cuisine: Redesign</h3>

    <p class="central">
        For my redesign, I decided to focus on using a simple color palette with bold colors similar 
        to previous websites. I played with different color palettes and worked with different 
        complimentary colors to see what would fit. In the end, I focused on using dark green as the 
        main color throughout the site and incorporating the yellow and blue from the logo to add 
        color variety.
    </p>

    <img class="imgcenter" src="assets/Palette.png">

    <p class="central">
        The redesigned homepage opens with a loading animation when the visitor first visits that 
        features the restaurant's logo and different elements fading in like the Filipino sun and 
        the PNGs of their famous barbeque skewers.
    </p>

    </video>

    <p class="central">
        The animation blends seamlessly into the top of the new homepage with the navigation bar 
        moving into the screen with a dark green to dark blue gradient background. Below the logo, 
        is an image carousel featuring their food from happy and satisfied customers. Following is 
        their mission statement and another carousel featuring Yelp reviews from locals and newcomers 
        talking about their experiences with the friendly employees and the delicious food. After 
        that is a section with an image of their famous barbeque along with their pancit with text 
        urging the visitor to look at their menu. Finally, the bottom section has their hours, location, 
        phone number, and an image of their restaurant on a map that would hyperlink to their address 
        on Google Maps.
    </p>
    
    <img class="imgcenter" src="assets/Homepage_Final.png">

    <p class="central">
        The redesigned About page goes into more detail about Fil-Am Cuisine's history and adds more 
        elements with pictures throughout each section. My goal was to make visitors feel a more personal 
        connection with the restaurant and their familial roots. These personal connections are key to 
        family-owned business and help build on the current rapport Fil-Am Cuisine has with their community. 
        Visitors become much more inclined to visit Fil-Am Cuisine when they understand their story and know 
        they aren't just supporting a business, but also a family. In my new About page, I removed any 
        unnecessary or repetitive information that could be placed in another page.
    </p>

    <img class="imgcenter" src="assets/About_Final.png">

    <p class="central">
        I decided to keep my design for their “Menu” page to be simple and use their PDF menu. Because 
        of how their business operates, they do not have a set menu and instead change the different entrees 
        they serve everyday. By using their PDF menu, visitors can see their meal prices and the different 
        party packages they have for catering without splitting it into four different menu pages. In order 
        to add variety, I added a green to yellow gradient to contrast the green to blue gradient I used for 
        the “Home” and “About” page.
    </p>

    <img class="imgcenter" src="assets/Menu_Final.png">

    <p class="central">
        The Catering page is very simple by having a carousel of their catering trays and the same information 
        from their current catering page. I removed the repeating information, made the text clear, and a 
        button to redirect visitors to their menu with their catering prices.
    </p>

    <!--Final Notes-->
    <h3>Future Adjustments</h3>

    <p class="central">
        Although I am satisfied with my final design, I believe there will always be room for improvement. 
        With possibilities of opening new branches, new design techniques, and other factors, I believe I 
        can update my redesign to be even better and add new interactions between visitors and the website. 
        For now, I feel my redesign of Fil-Am Cuisine's website expands upon its current capabilities with 
        a new look that catches any visitor's eye.
